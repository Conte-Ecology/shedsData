The catchments \r\nare similar to existing products such as the well-known NHD Plus dataset. \r\nBased on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), catchment layers contain \r\nfields to indicate routing paths which can be used to establish the network \r\nstructure. Some basic information about the layers is also included in the \r\nattribute tables. Layers representing riparian buffer zones in each catchment \r\nalso exist.\r\n\r\nThe NHDHRDV2 seeks to address specific aspects of existing hydrography products \r\nthat have proven to restrict their usefulness. Specifically, improved spatial \r\nresolution and consistency are the focus of the development of these products. \r\nCatchment delineation is based on the high resolution NHD flowlines. Currently, \r\nthere are no known large scale catchment products derived from this more detailed \r\nlayer. One primary focus of this product is to capture small headwater streams \r\nomitted by existing products such as the medium resolution catchments in NHDPlus \r\nVersion 2. Representing these streams can be critical to understanding key ecological \r\ninterests. Figure 1 shows the added catchment detail from the high resolution \r\nstreams in the Westbrook stream in Whately, MA.\r\n\r\n![Figure 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6216239/13364134/22316bc8-dc9b-11e5-93f9-3d1d0db73fb0.png)\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Catchment resolution compariston in the Westbrook, Whately, MA \r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\nResolution consistency is addressed in the creation of the high resolution \r\ncatchments. The NHD Plus Version 2 catchments, derived from the medium resolution \r\nNHD flowlines, are unnaturally inconsistent in area. The inconsistency is evidenced \r\nin Figure 2, which shows a regional view of the catchments. The unnatural catchment \r\narea differential shows up as straight lines between lighter and darker shades, \r\nindicating lesser and greater density of catchments respectively. These inconsistencies \r\npermeate the entire dataset and are a result of the varying resolution of existing \r\nhydrography data in the region. The areal inconsistency presents a problem for models \r\nrelying on drainage area as a driver as well as for visual representation of data layers. \r\n\r\n![Figure 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6216239/13364586/9ddedc0e-dc9d-11e5-8f8c-7b7126654b8a.png)\r\n\r\nFigure 2: NHDPlus Version 2 medium resolution catchments in the Northeast\r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\nThe issue shown above in the medium resolution layers also exists in the high \r\nresolution flowlines. It is evident from examining the flowline layers that the \r\ndataset has been processed in a gridded format at differing resolutions. The \r\ncatchments are developed using a methodology for improving areal consistency. \r\nThe hydrography layers created by this method are derived from a 30m resolution \r\ndigital elevation model and the NHD high resolution flowlines. The high resolution \r\nflowlines edited by the Designing Sustainable Landscapes (DSL) Project to eliminate \r\nnetwork gaps, correct flow direction, and remove coastline from the majority of \r\nthe flowline layer used. Raw NHD flowlines were edited in general accordance with \r\nthe DSL Project methodolgoy to produce whole watersheds that are not artificially \r\nsplit along poltical boundaries. Figure 3 shows the expansion added in the \r\ndelineation effort.\r\n\r\n![Range Expansion](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6216239/13403225/05fdcaa2-dee2-11e5-9368-0a92ad782b38.png)\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Range comparison between DSL Project boundary and NHDHRDV2 layers\r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\nThe final products adhere to an established areal consistency while managing to \r\ninclude higher resolution streams than the medium resolution products. The high \r\nresolution catchments, network, and flowlines form the foundation of the other \r\ndata in this project that go into SHEDS. The layers are divided by hydrologic \r\nregion as shown in Figure 4. Comprehensive documentation and citations for source \r\ndata can be found in the \r\n[NHDHRDV2 Documentation file](http://ecosheds.org/assets/nhdhrd/v2/NHDHRDV2_Documentation.docx).\r\n\r\n![Hydrologic Regions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6216239/13403701/55a1428a-dee4-11e5-952d-eded1daa6e83.png)\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Hydrologic region map\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the existing hydrography layers, it is possible to utilize the \r\nprocessing effort for delineating user-specified locations. The \r\n[MassDOT Deerfield Culvert Delineation](http://conte-ecology.github.io/culvertDelineation_MassDOT/) \r\nexemplifies this process for a separate project. Watersheds are delineated from \r\na culvert location layer and landscape attributes within the watersheds are \r\nassigned to each culvert location. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Products\r\nThe spatial hydrography products described in this section are currently \r\navailable on the download page. Each of the 4 layers described below are grouped \r\ninto the \"spatial_XX.zip\" files for each of the 6 hydrologic regions in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n#### Catchments\r\nThe catchments layer consists of polygons representing the drainage area \r\ncontributing to individual stream segments in the \"truncated flowlines\" network \r\ndescribed below. One catchment polygon exists per stream segment. A segment is \r\ndefined as the reach in between confluences. The table below describes the \r\nfields in the shapefile attributes table.\r\n\r\n|   Field    | Description                                                                                                                                               |   Type   |\r\n|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|\r\n|    FID     | A unqiue identifier specific to the spatial layer (required field)                                                                                        | Integer  |\r\n|   Shape    | The spatial geometry type of the layer such as \"Point\" or \"Polygon\"                                                                                       | Geometry |\r\n|   Source   | The process by which the catchment was defined.

The basin characteristics are spatially \r\nattributed to the zonal catchment layers through a series of ArcPy and R scripts. \r\nVarying source data structures are processed to create uniformly structured \r\nvalue raster layers that are attributed to the individual catchments and \r\naggregated to larger basins based on the network structure of the delineation\r\nproduct. The repository provides an in depth description of the processing steps \r\nand the different characteristics assigned. For a full list of variables refer \r\nto the [NHDHRDV2 Covariate Documentation spreadsheet](http://ecosheds.org/assets/nhdhrd/v2/NHDHRDV2_Covariate_Documentation.xlsx).\r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n### Products\r\nThe basin characteristics for the delineation products are made available on \r\nthe download page. Spatial averages for the full list of variables exist over \r\n4 zones: the catchment area plus 3 riparian buffer zones (50, 100, and 200ft). \r\nEach of the 4 zones are grouped into the \"covariates_XX.zip\" files for each of \r\nthe 6 hydrologic regions in Figure 4. The table below describes the fields in \r\nthe covariate CSV files.\r\n\r\n|        Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                |  Type   |\r\n|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|\r\n|      featureid       | The unique ID that links catchments to their respective flowlines or riparian buffers                                                                      | Integer |\r\n|       variable       | The variable name corresponding to the \"Name\" column of the NHDHRDV2 Covariate Documentation spreadsheet                                                   |  Text   |\r\n|        value         | The spatial average of the variable within the zone                                                                                                        | Double  |\r\n|         zone         | The area over which the values were spatially averaged.

The \r\nrepository README documents the process for assigning the climate records \r\nto each hydrologic catchment in the NHDHRDV2. \r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n## Tidal Influence Layer\r\n  \r\nRepository: [tidalLayer](https://github.com/Conte-Ecology/shedsData/tree/master/tidalLayer). \r\n\r\nThe tidal influence layer represents all water bodies within the SHEDS spatial \r\nrange that experience some form of tidal effect. Spatial layers from the \r\n[U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service - National Wetlands Inventory](http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Mapper.html) \r\nare processed to generate a spatial polygon layer of all of the tidal zones. \r\nThe processing documentation exists in the repository README. This layer is \r\nprimarily used to flag observed stream temperature sites that may be influenced \r\nby tides.\r\n<br><br>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n## Impoundment Influence Layer\r\n  \r\nRepository: [impoundments](https://github.com/Conte-Ecology/shedsData/tree/master/impoundments)\r\n\r\nThe impoundment influence layer is developed to represent the stream sections \r\nwithin the SHEDS hydrologic network that are impacted by impoundments. The product \r\nis a polyline layer representing the stream segments of a user-specified distance \r\ndownstream from each impoundments location. The impoundments dataset comes \r\nfrom the DSL Project where the locations from The Nature Conservancy's dam inventory \r\nwere snapped to the NHD high resolution flowlines. This source layer is not public \r\nand the resulting layer is only used within the SHEDS group. The processing \r\ndocumentation exists in the repository README. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact Info \r\n\r\nKyle O'Neil <br>\r\nkoneil@usgs.gov\r\n\r\nBenjamin Letcher <br>\r\nbletcher@usgs.gov \r\n",
